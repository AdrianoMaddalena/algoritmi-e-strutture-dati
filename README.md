## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
Each folder at the top level is named as Lesson_X where `X` identify the lesson number E.G. Lesson_01, Lesson_02, etc.
Under each module folder there will be a _.pdf_ file containing the exercises and one subfolder for each exercise named with its number E.G. 01, 02, etc.

## Running the Project
From the root directory run the command:
```go
  go run Module_<XX>/<exercise>/<fileName>.go
```

## Using different input
The input is hardcoded in the file. To change the input, modify the `sequence` variable in the file of a certain exercise.
